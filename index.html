        <h1>Good Morning!</h1>
        <p>I hope that you are all well and not feeling too pressured by your parents. Maybe I am assuming that your parents are in a break because of the cyclone, and that’s why.</p>
        <p>Hey, I wanted to share something with you. I was working on a website for 8 straight days without sleeping, and I almost gave up on it. But yesterday, I thought about you instead of myself. I realized how much I wanted to talk to you, whether on WhatsApp or another platform.</p>
        <p>So, with all my dedication, I created a website that actually works! We can both chat there. You can open the site in incognito mode and log in with your account. Don’t worry; I made sure it’s secure and only we will know about it.</p>
        <p>In the future, I will make it an even better alternative just for us. Here is the link, and I’ll be waiting for you there:</p>
        <p>
            <button onclick="copyLink()" class="copy-button">Copy Link</button>
        </p>
        <p>Also, please use the username <strong>"PnP"</strong> and my username is <strong>"SS-P"</strong>.</p>
